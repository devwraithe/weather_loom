# Weather Loom

Weather Loom is a mobile application that shows up-to-date information and weather forecasts using data from the Open Weather API. The power of Dart & Flutter along with BLoC for state management as well as the API from <a href="https://api.openweathermap.org/">Open Weather</a> has been harnessed to bring this product to life. Inspiration for the design is in most part from the iOS Weather application.
